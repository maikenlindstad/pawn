        <p>Removed the "view" buttons. I would say that the view button is obsolete, we click on whatever image we just scanned.</p>
        <p> Before I added the cart function I made the css for the product-specific and cart pages. + Added loaders. 
          
          When displaying the products in cart I could not bring the images with me. They did not want to join the object I put them in. It seemed to me as if they were ".../" a folder behind. So I tried to solve it with fetching them in two different sections. First everything but the images, then the images.  
          
          Had to use CSS grid to make them look like the belong together, as they do - even though they are in different divs. I have a different method in mind, but do not have the time to test it out. This would be adding them in their respected data-something="go.back.a.folder" type thing. 
          
           </p>
        <p>The images would not join in one object with the rest of the products information. this made the CSS tricky.</p>

        <p>Filtering products all day long. Got hold of a teacher which helped me out with a code, but the code did not help. The video did - I learned a lot, but the code did not work. Got help from a student and she found some of the issues very quick, but the code is NOT completed. </p> 

          <p> I tried to figure out what to do and ended up with being able to filter and for 0.5 seconds it shows the product, but then render the entire list again. 
          </p>

          <p>I see what I am doing wrong though, but I don't have the brain capacity to understand how to do it right. If I try to right my wrong it all disappears. 
          </p>
         
          <p>   I realized that I will not be able to complete the project at all this time so I just have to put a pin in this and start on the other tasks.</p>
            
          <p> I still have these tasks left: </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Add to cart </li>
            <li>Calculate in cart</li>
            <li>User testing </li>

            <li>UI/UX</li>

            <li>Report</li>
          </ul>
        <p>I see that the marking criteria does not include the report so I will present this log instead - which basically is a report, just in a different form. This frees up another day/half a day to code.

        <p>Even though the last code we got from the school was not to advanced the code did not work at first, but I found out that if we set the settings in Strapi to let the public alter the product then it works like clockwork. This led me to believe that there might be a fault  in the settings somewhere, and maybe even with the Strapi API itself. I needed more information and understanding before ruling these questions out. I eventually found that there was a line in the code which was not supposed to be there. As soon as that one was weeded out everything worked well. </p>
